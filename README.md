# Advent of Code 2024

I'm back for AoC 2024, this time in PHP!

## Input
All input is read from TXT files under the `inputs/` folder that you need to make prior to executing any code.

## Environment Details

My PHP version:
```bash
$ php -v
PHP 8.4.1 (cli) (built: Nov 20 2024 09:48:35) (NTS)
Copyright (c) The PHP Group
Zend Engine v4.4.1, Copyright (c) Zend Technologies
    with Zend OPcache v8.4.1, Copyright (c), by Zend Technologies
```

To execute a specific PHP file I do:
```bash
$ php hello.php
Hello, World!
```
